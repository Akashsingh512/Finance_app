Project goal: Build a small, reliable Android app (APK) named Personal Finance to let a single user track Savings, Expenses, Debt, Needs, and Wants.
Hard requirements

Currency: All amounts shown and stored must use Indian Rupees (₹).

Local persistence only: Use on-device storage (SQLite/sqflite or an equivalent local DB). Data must remain accessible after 3+ months (i.e., permanent storage unless the app is uninstalled or user clears app data).

No demo data: On first launch the database must be empty. Do not prefill sample transactions.

Offline functionality: App works without network connectivity. No cloud sync by default.

Core features

Add transaction: title, amount (₹), date, category (Saving / Expense / Debt / Need / Want), optional notes.

Edit & delete transactions.

Monthly view & historical navigation (view previous months).

Overview cards showing sums per category and total balances.

Search & filter by date range and category.

Export & import backup (CSV or JSON) to local storage / Downloads folder so user can preserve data outside the app.

Optional: PIN / biometric lock (mention as optional in README).

UI / UX

Simple Material Design, responsive for phone screens.

Start screen shows Overview and Recent Transactions.

All currency labels show ₹.

Technical stack & deliverables

Preferred: Flutter with sqflite for storage (so the project builds cross-platform if needed). If another stack is used, document why.

Deliver:

Signed release APK (or if you cannot provide a signed binary, include exact steps and a key.properties template and instructions to produce a signed .apk).

Full source code (hosted in Git repository).

A clear README including: how to set up the dev environment (GitHub Codespaces + Flutter + Android SDK commands), how to build debug & release APKs, how to sign the app, and how to install the APK on an Android phone.

Simple test checklist verifying persistence (e.g., add transactions, close app, reopen after a simulated time / reboot — data remains).

Acceptance criteria

On fresh install the app shows no transactions.

User can add a transaction in ₹ and immediately see it in monthly and category summaries.

After closing and reopening the app (and after 90 days), the transaction remains available.

User can export transactions to a CSV and import them back.

Optional but recommended

Provide both an unsigned debug APK (for quick install) and instructions or helper scripts to produce a signed release APK.

Add automatic backup option (local export schedule) and a manual restore flow.
